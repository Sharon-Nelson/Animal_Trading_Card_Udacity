<p>The emperor penguin is the largest of 17 species of penguins. It is also the only animal to inhabit the open ice of Antarctica during the winter.
They have small bills and flippers, which helps to conserve heat, and special nasal chambers that minimize the heat normally emitted through exhalation.Emperor penguins are also specially adapted to travling in this extreme habitat. On the ice masses, they use stong claws on their feet to help grip the surface as they shuffle along. They also slide on their sleek bellies while pushing with their feet.
